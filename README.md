# AI-Generated Environment Map with Depth Estimation

This project is a simple VR environment map with depth estimation, featuring AI-generated environment maps. The environment maps are generated using Stable Diffusion, while the depth map estimation is done using MiDaS. The project is built using WebGL and Three.js, and bundled with Vite.
